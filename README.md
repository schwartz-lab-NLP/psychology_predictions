## Abstract

This study investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automatically assess the effectiveness of psychotherapy sessions for individuals battling depression. Utilizing the "Depressometer" dataset, comprising transcribed therapy session dialogues and patient-reported outcome measures, we fine-tuned a quantized Llama2 model to predict session impact based on changes in the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS) scores. Despite challenges related to quantization limitations and GPU resource constraints, this study acted as a pioneer for future investigations in the lab and demonstrated the feasibility for future research in leveraging LLMs for mental health applications. This research contributes to the growing field of AI-assisted mental health care, aiming to develop automated tools that enhance therapy effectiveness and improve patient outcomes.
